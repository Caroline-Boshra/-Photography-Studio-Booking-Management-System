# -Photography-Studio-Booking-Management-System
 This project is a complete back-end API for a photography studio website built using pure PHP and MySQL without any frameworks. It provides secure, token-based access for the admin, and allows clients to book sessions, while the admin can manage the team, projects, and bookings.
